# <a name="GUID-1D2971AF-D537-4521-ACAA-D910F50C43E0"/> IP address of host systems

By default, Swarm Learning uses the host network to connect and communicate with its peers. In this case, the IP addresses represent the IP addresses or a fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) of the host systems on which the containers are run. Swarm Learning can be configured to use a Docker bridge network. In this case, the IP addresses represent the IP addresses or FQDN of the containers themselves.
