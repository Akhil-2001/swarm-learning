Hewlett Packard Enterprise customer self repair \(CSR\) programs allow you to repair your product. If a CSR part needs to be replaced, it will be shipped directly to you so that you can install it at your convenience. Some parts do not qualify for CSR. Your Hewlett Packard Enterprise authorized service provider will determine whether a repair can be accomplished by CSR.

For more information about CSR, contact your local service provider.
