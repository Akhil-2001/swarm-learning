#### Resolution
Fix for above issue requires to make sure following two things.

##### 1. Running AutoPass License Server (APLS)
Run ``docker ps | grep apls``  -> If apls container is not running, then license server is not running, and you need to start it using  
``swarm-learning-install-dir/swarm-learning/bin/run-apls`` 

Browse to APLS management console.
If the browser response is, "this site canâ€™t be reached" / "refused to connect" - It means APLS is not running correctly. Restart run-apls script as mentioned above. 

##### 2. Setting up Swarm License
Download the Swarm License.
Install the license using APLS management console.
