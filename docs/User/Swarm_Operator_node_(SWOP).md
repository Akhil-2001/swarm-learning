# <a name="GUID-5F7569ED-23C9-4091-A229-D7AF18E11A2E"/> Swarm Operator node \(SWOP\)

SWOP is responsible to execute tasks that are assigned to it. A SWOP node can execute only one task at a time. Other than executing tasks, SWOP provides multiple functionalities such as:

-   Managing Swarm Learning operations—SWOP eases the management of tasks because of its ability to perform control operations across the Swarm Learning network. It also uses a simple interface to manage operations from anywhere.

-   Scalability—SWOP can manage hundreds of Swarm Learning nodes with the use of one command.

-   Automation—SWOP eases automation of Swarm operations by providing APIs for scripting.
